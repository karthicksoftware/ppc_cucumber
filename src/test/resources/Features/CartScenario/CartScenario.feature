As a User
I want to navigate to the ppc application and validate the feature

Scenario: Validate product is added into the cart
Given the user launches the application
When the user enters username as 'prodtest90@mailinator.com' and password as 'Test@123'
Then the user should be landed on home page
#When the user selects 'Computer and Electronics' from category
#Then the user should be navigated to search results page

#Then the product should be added into the cart successfully
